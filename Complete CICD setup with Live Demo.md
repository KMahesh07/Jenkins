# Complete CICD setup with Live Demo

## Learn how to write an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and Argo CD
- Explore the advantages of using Argo CD for continuous delivery
- Understand the simplicity of configuring Argo CD through UI
- Discover the benefits of using Jenkins for continuous integration
- Learn about the future of Jenkins pipelines with Kubernetes architecture

## The goal is to make a change to the deployed to-do application
- Install Argo CD to get the application up and running quickly.
- Access the application using the generated URL and make a simple header modification to the to-do list.

## My GitHub repository is public and can be accessed for use.
- Follow me on GitHub for updates and posts.
- The repository includes a to-do application.
- You can use the repository for your own demos and practice.

## Deploy a new image with Argo CD and trigger Jenkins pipeline

- Using Argo CD, a new image is built and deployed onto the Kubernetes cluster with zero manual intervention.
- Due to firewall settings, a web hook from GitHub to Jenkins cannot be triggered, so the 'Build Now' button is used to trigger the Jenkins pipeline.
- The Jenkins pipeline pulls the Jenkins file from the GitHub repository and executes the stages defined in the file.
- The first stage, 'checkout', retrieves the latest changes from the GitHub repository.

## Jenkins has a pipeline syntax generator for groovy scripting.
- Use the pipeline syntax generator for help with writing groovy scripts in Jenkins.
- The generator can generate syntax based on the commands you want to execute.
- Use declarative pipelines for standard pipelines and easy troubleshooting.
- Scripted pipelines offer more flexibility and customization options.

## Updating and managing Kubernetes manifests using Jenkins pipeline

- Pushing artifacts to a centralized Docker repository
- Storing Kubernetes manifests in a separate repository for better organization and security

## The Jenkins build has created a new Docker image and updated it in Docker Hub and GitHub repository
- Argo CD has synced the updated image stack from the repository
- The new image stack has been successfully deployed on the Kubernetes cluster

## Writing a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and GitHub
- Execute the entire pipeline in less than a minute
- No need for development skills or prior experience with Argo CD
- Create a Jenkins file in the root of the GitHub repository
- Significance of the Jenkins file in creating a Jenkins job

## Use Jenkins pipeline to execute Jenkins jobs

- Choose between writing pipeline script or using pipeline script from SCM (source code repository)
- Advantages of using pipeline script from SCM: easy auditing, version controlling, and tracking of changes
- Preferably store Jenkins file in a GitHub repository
- Execute Jenkins file to run the Jenkins job

## Argo CD is a tool that deploys manifest artifacts from your GitHub repository onto your Kubernetes cluster

- Argo CD is based on the principles of GitHub and takes whatever you put in your GitHub repository, including Helm charts, customized files, or plain Kubernetes manifest files, and deploys them onto your Kubernetes cluster.
- One advantage of Argo CD is that it can auto heal your configuration, preventing unauthorized modifications.
- To use Argo CD, simply fill out the application form with the desired name and configuration.

## Automate deployment and updates using Argo CD
- Configure Argo CD to automatically deploy changes from GitHub to Kubernetes
- Provide GitHub repository, path, Kubernetes cluster URL, and deployment namespace
- Argo CD will pick up changes from the repository and deploy them
- No need to manually update the repository for new changes
- Jenkins manages the Kubernetes Manifest repository
- Jenkins and Argo CD work together to complete the end-to-end CI/CD pipeline

## Argo CD is a deployment tool that pulls artifacts from GitHub and deploys to Kubernetes without manual intervention.
